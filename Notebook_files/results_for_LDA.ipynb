      "After searching for dog friendly restaurants in the area I am very pleased to have found the Grapevine Cafe. It was the end of a long, busy vacation and was looking for something with a more relaxed atmosphere that we could all just enjoy good food and conversation. The ambiance filled that expectation of a comfortable, relaxed atmosphere. The patio was spacious and inviting for all of us including the dog. The staff was attentive, friendly and never made is feel rushed. They truly made us feel like guests in their home. We ordered appetizers, salads and pasta, it was all prepared perfectly with small twists on dishes to call them their own. I wish I could get their recipe for their Penne Pasta a la Vodka, it was the best thing I had in a long time and have to thank our waiter Luis for such great recommendations for food/ wine pairings. We all had a great experience and will definitely come back when in Vegas!!\n",
      "In my opinion, it has gone downhill since the new location opened at DTS.  I have been getting the penne a la vodka for over 10 years, and it just is not good anymore.  Also the staff is lax.  The baked brie is always good as is the wine selection though.  Maybe just for happy hour brie and wine I would go 4.5 stars.\n",
      "Recently attended a wine event hosted by the owner of a vineyard.... totally recommend this restaurant.... food is excellent and service totally matches... looking for a really nice wine / food bar... look no further.. quaint and quality ownership..... you need to make this a must visit for local dining....\n",
      "We have found a new spot for happy hour!!  Half price wines and specials for the apps!  The new owners are very pleasant and make this a place to feel like you're a part of their family.  \n",
      "We had the bacon wrapped scallops and the goat cheese with pistachio and honey, both were outstanding!  We really like their wine selection, and the staff is very attentive to our requests and makes great recommendations, taking the guess work out of choosing a wine.  \n",
      "We are very pleased with the new ownership and staff, and the food is an upgrade, as well.\n",
      "Wanted to check this place out because we got a certificate from restaurant.com. Unfortunately we came pretty late and the kids were a little crabby so we ended up taking our main entrée home to go. We had calamari for appetizers and it was good. We got home and want to eat our entrée. So pictured are the chicken Parmesan and the chicken marsala. In my opinion it wasn't worth paying $22 each for this amount of food and the chocolate milk that the kids got were $5 each. Just a little pricy for us, great place for a date just not budget friendly for this family.\n",
      "Food is always great and the staff is exceptionally sincere about service.  I participated in a wine pairing dinner featuring Tobin James wines and Tobin James was there to share his life stories on how his winery began and some background on the varieties. This type of wine paring dinner is really a lot of fun and a great value. Adam was our server and his level of detail was excellent. Basically it felt like the entire restaurant was pulled out of Paso Robles and landed in Las Vegas.  Too much fun and awesome wine, food and service!\n",
      "Great ambience for a relaxing dining experience. A variety of wines to choose from and food was fine. Not exactly the best food in comparison to other restaurants, but acceptable. Customer service is good and prompt. Bartender told us to check out a special event they are having and some wine tasting before we left. We will come back again! Worthwhile to check out if you love fine dining!\n",
      "A little on the expensive side... But I love the deal I received through email for $35 for a bottle of wine and a cheese platter. They should do this more often. My friend and I had a blast and also ordered the jalapeño scallops which were absolutely divine!\n",
      "Great place. Stopped by for lunch and we were invited back for wine at 5:30pm....we had plans on the strip but it was a extra treat to get invited since this was our first visit. Next time were in LV we will stop by again. The owner Linda, turned us on to a great new wine!!\n",
      "Visited this restaurant when it was Grape Street and now the name has changed to Grape Vine but food is still very good.  They have basically the same menu and I had the lunch sandwich of eggplant parmigiana with jalapeños which gave it just enough of a kick.  My friends had the salmon burger and they said they thought it was going to be chopped salmon but it was actually a piece of salmon which they said was very good.  The restaurant has an extensive wine list but we did not have wine for lunch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prices of the lunch sandwiches were reasonable but I did notice that the prices for dinner went up making it an expensive place to go for just a regular night out.\n",
      "Attention Foodies in Vegas, this is an important review because there has been a change in ownership which is a wonderful thing. Here's why...\n",
      "1. New owners are experts in customer service and it shows from the moment you arrive.\n",
      "2. Staff is happy and their service shows it\n",
      "3.. Food is much better then before. Menus are primarily the same. The chalk boards are still available for easy ordering. Amazing dessert menu beckons a visit just for coffee and dessert after a movie. But dinner is a must.\n",
      "4.Wine list is superior to the old owners choices, enjoyable Happy Hour\n",
      "5. Delicious, Outdoor dining, easy parking, incredible atmosphere and great wines... what more could you ask for from a neighborhood restaurant\n",
      "Love the amazing selection of wine. Everything I was\n",
      "Impeccably presented and cooked to perfection!\n",
      "This is my 4th or 5th time here. Service is always great but tonight was a special event, Frankie Moreno's \"Diva\" wine release party. We had an amazing time, our server Bryan was amazing, Linda and the crew did a great job for the large volume of people that they had this evening! Apparently Robin Leach was next to us for dinner\n",
      "This is our new go-to favorite when we are in the Las Vegas area. The ambiance is nice and the decor makes you feel welcomed and at home. Unlike most of the restaurants on the Strip, there is no pretentiousness whatsoever. The service was great and the food was delicious. Everything tasted fresh and exceeded our expectations. We had the New England clam chwder, which was stocked with clams. The BBQ pizza was awesome and my husband's chicken marsala was wonderful. Definitely a great place we plan on visiting again.\n",
      "Run, don't walk to Grape Vine! YUMMY!!!!!!! Where do I begin? We started off with some appetizers which did not disappoint. The baked brie is to die for!! \n",
      "The Branzino is by far the best in town. The owner Linda is such a doll. She touches every table and will even do impromptu wine tastings. He Energy and positivity alone will keep us coming back for more.\n",
      "This is a true hidden gem in Vegas! It is a wine bar, so it is extremely romantic and the ambience is just so relaxing! The baked brie does not disappoint! They bake the Brie in a flaky pastry, and once you open it, you will find sweet caramelized onions, toasted hazelnuts and apricot jam! They serve it with toast, pears and grapes! It is one of my favorite things to eat! Their pasta dishes and chocolate fondue is also a big must! The service is wonderful as well. Definitely worth a try!\n",
      "What a gem! This place has the most amazing food and wine selection for off the strip! Definitely the go to place for a date.  Try the blackened ribeye with wasabi aioli, it's out of this world! I will be back ASAP!!!\n",
      "My boyfriend and I came here because we had a 50$ gift certificate. Unfortunately, the certificate was for grape street, but that address. I guess Grape Street transitioned to DT Summerlin and Grape Vine didn't honor it. This totally sucked, but I could tell the server genuinely felt bad and wished she could help out. \n",
      "Also, when we walked in there was no hostess at the host stand. We weren't sure whether to seat ourselves or what was going on. The bartender noticed, and he ran right over to seat us. Which was kind of him. \n",
      "Besides these things the experience was great. Our server was phenomenal. Always filled our water when we were getting low, way personable and attentive. She didn't even write down our order... it was all memorized, and came out exactly the way we asked. \n",
      "The food was memorable. My boyfriend had the house salad with their champagne dressing. I had a taste and it was amazingly refreshing. He ate the entire thing in 5 mins to say the least lol. \n",
      "We then shared the pene ala vodka with chicken. The sauce had a surprisingly new flavor that was really good and distinctly different than others I've had before. Then we shared the Margarita pizza. I'm a pizza fanatic so it wasn't hard to impress me in this category. The cheese was a perfect blend and melted in your mouth. Tomatoes weren't overpowering which I feel like happens a lot with this type of pizza and crust was flakey. Overall it was a great meal, and we left feeling so full. \n",
      "The scenery is filled with romantic tunes, it's not overly crowded and there are twinkling lights everywhere. It really sets a tone, with out coming off too fancy. Great cute/causal date night spot.\n",
      "Run away, dont walk.  \n",
      "Although the service is good, the management is not interested in customer service retention, arrogant, and ignorant. No use to argue with stupidity. \n",
      "The quality vs. price of food is substandard.\n",
      "We were treated with disregard and disrespect.  The owners boyfriend must have been drinking the \"Wine\" and tried to hit on our whole table of women who were unreceptive to his relentless pursuit.  His gross debauchery turned our meals up. \n",
      "This isnt a place for anyone.....especially families, children, or date nite.\n",
      "It is good  for lunch and dinner and happy hour. We love the blackened salmon salad , beet salad with salmon and penne vodka. Service is good. The atmosphere is nice. The manager/owner is always there to make sure everything is done right and to assist the patron if anything is needed.\n",
      "I love, love, love Grape Vine. Problem is, I'm here too often :) Seriously, this is a great place to take clients for lunch or cocktails or just to hang out and grab a quick and delicious appetizer and glass of great wine. After dozens of times being here, I've never had anything but a great experience with great service and delicious food and wine. Love it!\n",
      "Food and wine was pretty good. Nothing compared to the Original Grape Street.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man that claimed to be the owner was arrogant and didn't honor a certificate we had, even though we discussed it before ordering.   \n",
      "\n",
      "The food was excellent, but his demeanor will be the reason why we won't return.\n",
      "\n",
      "Update, response to the comment. \n",
      "The certificate was valid and not expired, and was for the correct restaurant.  I'd be happy to post a picture of the unused certificate.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We wanted separate checks one for the full price food and one for the rest of my party that was enjoying happy hour.  He said that would be fine but at the end of the evening he reneged.\n",
      "My husband & I decided to drive around to find a new place to eat & stopped in here a few weeks ago. We sat in the outdoor area & the weather was perfect for it. Service was awesome! food was ok. Hubby loved his, but I found out I am not a fan of marsala. Still gave them 5 stars. My taste buds are not a reason to knock them down. :-). Will definitely be back!\n",
      "Oh, I also signed up Restaurants.com & got a $30 for $15 deal for them!\n",
      "Where to start!! First! Get off the strip in Vegas and head straight over! We are here on vacation and found this place on Groupon ... we have eaten here twice this week! Linda is the owner - she actually comes out to say hello!  the must haves are the Gorgonzola pasta and the filet Oscar!! The wine list is amazing and I found a new favorite. We will be back next year on vacation! Thank you Linda for an amazing adventure in food- wine  and flavors!!\n",
      "Bryan was our server and he was phenomenal. He perfectly timed our food so  that we had enough time to enjoy the appetizer and had some time before the entree. You could see he had a good knowledge of the menu and of the timing. We tried the  baked brie appetizer. It was worth the wait! ( it takes around 18 minutes) . The flaky pastry pouch, the delicate combination of flavors,  it gets better with every bite.\n",
      "As entree I tried the vodka sauce and I was really disappointed unfortunately. The pasta was way overcooked it felt apart as you tried to grab it with the fork and it was blend, it did not have the creamy rich flavor.  I will definitely try something different than pasta next time. My husband had the prosciutto pizza. The dough was pretty good considering they don't have a wood oven and the cooked prosciutto crudo was great with the caramelized onions and fresh basil. After all great atmosphere and good experience definitely coming back to find the entree that will match how great our appetizer was.\n",
      "Different owner, same menu(a few tweaks) and food was superb!!! Moeen and Linda are veey hospitable. Still the best spot in Vegas.\n",
      "I wanted to take my husband out for a quiet meal and asked him where he would like to go, and he said the old Grape Street even though we live five minutes from DTS.  So, arriving at the restaurant, we were seated in a cozy corner table but the lighting was much too bright.  The management quickly accommodated us by lowering the lights, thus creating a warm ambience.  The food was outstanding (much better than DTS) and the service was perfect, attentive but not intrusive.  The sound level was low even though a large party was next to us.  We enjoyed a lovely dining experience.  Only when we left did I notice the name change, and when I got home and researched it discovered that there was new ownership.  It is outstanding and well worth the extra drive.  There is convenient parking, the tables are not crowded together and you can actually have a conversation.  My only advice to new owners is to maintain the quality and keep those lights down! \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We went back again and it is even better!  The service was excellent and unrushed.  This will definitely be my favorite place to relax over a delicious meal.\n",
      "Great wine selection and well prepared delicious dishes. Portions are on the huge side, but everything was well seasoned and well made. \n",
      "This is the old GrapeStreet location with new owners and a name change... And I must say its better with the food and wine than the DTS GrapeStreet location!  Enjoyed it!\n",
      "This is the best every day restaurant in the Summerlin and it's also a fun choice for date night. You might like the most about this restaurant is the service. Owner and the rest of the team will make you feel like you're the guest of honor at a very VIP party without being overbearing. Besides great atmosphere and being a fun place to spend an evening, the kitchen always knocks it out of the park.\n",
      "The menu has a number of healthy, simply-prepared light dishes, as well as heartier items. \n",
      "Menu is fine dining without being snobby or outrageously expensive. \n",
      "Don't miss great selection of some boutique wine recommendation from well versed servers or knowledgeable owner. Thanks to the thoughtful wine list this place might become a popular oenophile hangout. \n",
      "I'll go back for sure!\n",
      "This is the cutest place, I really enjoyed it. The food is excellent, please try the shrimp cocktail..it's amazing and fresh! the service was awesome, our waiter Todd was awesome as well..very attentive and sweet. The atmosphere here is very romantic, this is the place for a 1st date or any date, beautiful place very very clean.\n",
      " I will return:)!!!!\n",
      "We had seafood pasta & eggplant parmegian,  both were delicious. Service was excellent & atmosphere very charming. We could even have a conversation at a normal level. Book a nice evening here. Wine is excellent.\n",
      "This review is for the duckhorn and decoy wine dinner 10.6.16   First off I will say over all great value for $85 per person plus tax and gratuity for app, salad, entree, dessert and four glasses of wine. However there is room to improve these events.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Positives:\n",
      "Value: good\n",
      "Food: good\n",
      "Wine: good\n",
      "Raffle: good\n",
      "Half off bottle discount: good \n",
      "\n",
      "Negatives:\n",
      "Not everyone in the restaurant was apart of the wine dinner.  Wine dinner guests were spread out throughout the restaurant.  Kinda weird when table next to us were just trying to eat while wine dinner announcements were made. \n",
      "\n",
      "Raffle was good idea but... more is always better.  Four bottles were raffled. It would have been nice for more wine andrestaurant gift certificates to be raffled off as well. This is in comparison to Flemings wine dinners.  \n",
      "\n",
      "It was also a disappointment that we were unable to revisit the wines provided.  We were told they were out, however bottles for sale?!? Huh.  Open one and pour. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall I will be back for happy hour but will prob opt for Flemings wine dinner.  A bit pricier but worth the experience.\n",
      "Went with a friend just to enjoy some food, good wine and conversation. Great atmosphere and plenty of wine options. We went toward the end of happy hour, which made all of the prices nice when you are watching your budget but want a splurge. The appetizers were good, though putting veggies with the hummus instead of just pita would be a good idea. I want to back to try their desserts out. The only reason this isn't a 5 rating is because $17 a glass (regular price) is a bit high.\n",
      "ANNIVERSARY SPECIAL?? Let me keep this simple. Food- fresh and delicious. \n",
      "Service? Painfully slow. \n",
      "And lastly, were you invited to take advantage of their anniversary special? I ordered a large piece of salmon atop a Greek salad and evidently that did not qualify as an entrée although salmon alone would. We witnessed another couple squabble over the \"anniversary special\" and then leave in a fury. \n",
      "A manager of sorts who was putting metaphorical fires out left and right, discounted our ticket 20%. That was enough to keep me from raging, but who wants be invited to an anniversary special only to be denied after the fact. Nope- not going back.\n",
      "I came here with my aunt for a nice lunch. When we arrived the staff greeted us right away. When we sat down they brought us water. When we ordered out food,  it came out very quickly. Thy also had very good cappuccinos. The food was a great and so we're the prices.\n",
      "This is one of our favorite local places! The owners are present and aware. NYE was fantastic. The food is very good!\n",
      "As someone who requires a gluten free diet, this is one place i feel safe. They have gluten free pizza, pasta AND buns! \n",
      "Brittany and Bryan are very friendly and always make us feel welcome. \n",
      "Michelle the bartender remembers our favorite drinks and is also friendly.\n",
      "Happy hour is buy one get one free on and beer or glass of wine!\n",
      "Beautiful ambience, great location, friendly people, great food...whats not to love?\n",
      "Amazing restaurant and thank you so much to the waiter for being so pleasant even though my date was inebriated and a bit testy. The penne Ala vodka is really something special unfortunate that the pasta was not al dente or I would have easily given this spot five stars. But I love pasta cooked in the perfect density so that is a big thing for me. The reisling I had was a perfect pair for the dish and not too sweet. I would recommend this restaurant for a date night to a young couple or elderly just a beautiful little spot the ambiance is wonderful and the outside seating really makes for a special night for you and a significant other to enjoy all year round.\n",
      "I stopped here for happy hour. Their menu would not load online so I chanced it.  Two for one beer and wine, I had a peroni. Waiter was fine, service was ok. I did wait longer than usual for a menu and for my bill. I ordered the tapas which sounded great, and looked ok too but tastes very average- bad. Waiter asked if there was something wrong with it, no, just wasn't good lol. I ate the bread and roasted garlic. Hated the eggplant (mushy and tasteless), the dip was overpowered with dill, the spanakopita had an odd fishy taste (?) and the meatballs were too rare for my taste.\n",
      "First time and what a nice surprise. Delicious salmon burger. Glass of wine and wallah lovely lunch. Very nice time and very pleasant staff. I am new to Las Vegas and so far best meal\n",
      "Dimly lt atmosphere, fast service, got checked up on few times while I was eating. waitress asked where my date was, i said my date is my chicken parmesan lol. great place to have a good meal. I'll be back.\n",
      "Lovely staff and owners!! The food was amazing and the servers are very friendly (and funny). The menu is definitely smaller than the other location (Grape Street) but it helped me venture out from my usual order and try something different. I snagged a couple french fries from my boyfriend's meal and those were enough to keep me coming back!\n",
      "They have a pretty decent wine selection and many by the glass wines to choose from.\n",
      "The outdoor seating is fabulous, but inside seating also has a very nice cozy feel.\n",
      "We started with the Calamari and Crab Stuffed Shrimp as our appetizers, and both were great! The loaf of fresh bread was perfect compliment for sopping up all the wonderful scampi sauce from the shrimp.\n",
      "I really really really love their Penne Ala Vodka Sauce!!!!! Penne, prosciutto, asparagus, parmesan cheese, basil, pink vodka sauce. Cooked perfectly, sauce is dreamy!!!!\n",
      "Hubby had the Seared Ahi Tuna, its is Sesame crusted Ahi seared rare, soy ginger, wasabi aioli, asparagus, and leek mashed potatoes. \n",
      "This is one of my favorite little neighborhood pasta spots!\n",
      "Enjoyed a wonderful ladies lunch today. Great food and wine. Nice ambiance and excellent service.  Our waiter, Rudy, was attentive, informative, and pleasant. Grape Vine remains one of my favorite local restaurants.\n",
      "Grape Vine Cafe (nee Grape Street). Though the restaurant has changed names slightly (and owners, too), this place is still recognizably a nice choice for a casual yet sophisticated meal. I've had dinner here a couple times this year and both times have left me happy and sated. \n",
      "\n",
      "Big wine menu, and for good reason, too. They also sell wine here in a retail setting. (It's a little like Marche in that regard). We shared a Kim Crawford Chard, and even though I generally prefer to stay with Cali or other West Coast wineries, it's tough to argue with Kim. \n",
      "\n",
      "Caesar Salad: Do it. Crisp and just garlicky enough. And, feel free to speak up if you'd like it a little less-dressed. A few of us at our table had the Caesar, and the kitchen had no trouble pulling back for one who requested it. Also, speak up if you like anchovies. I do, and often ask for them when I do a Caesar -- but most places can't accommodate. Grape Vine can and does. \n",
      "\n",
      "To the entrees: I had a special: Bone In Ribeye. Nicely prepared with a peppercorn sauce. 22oz, so it was perfect to save some for the next day. I can't say it was the most amazing steak ever, but it was very good, and at a very decent price point for the cut. Someone else at our table had the salmon (which they frequently enjoy here). Another had the veal parm - another winner. Still another tried manicotti for the first time ever - and they really enjoyed it as well. Portions are big, so be prepared for some possible leftovers.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you can save room for dessert, get what we always get: The Chocolate Fondue. Depending on the size of our party, we might get two -- or bulk up on the cake part if we're just getting one. It's tasty and just sweet enough. A fine way to finish.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grape Vine is in a Shopping Mall but don't let that throw you. Once inside, you'll hear good music (perhaps Frank), and your eyes will settle into the dark, attractive venue. The owners are sometimes visible, and are always interested in a chat - if you like.\n",
      "Just as I remembered, great food, great service. I had dinner here tonight with family and it was a very nice dining experience. Adam, our server, was awesome!\n",
      "Not only is the food outstanding, our server, Luis, provided some of the best service I've seen in a very long time. Try the eggplant parmigiana. You won't be disappointed. Great atmosphere to top it off.\n",
      "The little shopping area that this place is located doesn't have much else that looks good to eat so I decided to come here with my attorney friend.   I ordered the chicken Parma sandwich and thought it was pretty good.  He ordered some kind of tapas and thought it was pretty good.  I really give about a 3.5.  I would go back but I would also try other local places.    Friendly service and nice place.\n",
      "So I haven't been back here for a few months and I noticed a few things different this time around. The service seems to be more attentive, the steak salad I normally order seems to be more fresh and steak meat in salad is more flavorful, and the portions are a little more generous. For example, I normally ask for extra dressing on the side and this time I didn't need it. The atmosphere seems to be more intimate like its run as a family business. \n",
      "\n",
      "I asked my waiter if they were under new management and he confirmed it's under new ownership. Well that explains it. I've always loved coming here. Even though I live 7 minutes away from the new one in Summerlin Downtown, I still find myself driving the extra 10 minutes to come back to this one. The new owner Linda stopped by to say hi and super nice by the way. She's all about quality and service. I was fine with the way it was before, but I have to say \"I love this place\" even more and will definitely be coming back to this one. The new one lacks quality and service and you pay a premium to dine/drink there. I don't have a problem paying the premium, but if you can get it all in one place, why not come to this one. So let your steering wheel drive you here.\n",
      "Sucked. Owner is rude and told us to leave because I said the chicken in my salad was old and hard!!! Jerk!!!\n",
      "This dog friendly restaurant is great if you are  traveling with your pet.  The patio is completely covered so there is shade and plenty of spots for them to lay down. They even bring out a little water dish for Bob.  Although the service was good, their food wasn't.  Nothing tastes like it was homemade or doctored up with store bought items. \n",
      "\n",
      "Salad: the house salad that came with my entree looked a little sad because it wasn't bright green. Instead it was the iceberg lettuce that you can get in a bag at the grocery store for $0.99. They sprinkled some sort of vinaigrette but I didn't really like it. There's also chopped apples in it, but ehh. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bruschetta: I love that they add a lot of tomatoes and basil, but the goat cheese kinda threw me off. \n",
      "\n",
      "Shrimp cocktail: the shrimp were pretty big and juicy. It was the cocktail sauce that I wish was better because if tasted store bought. They also added more of that ugly light green lettuce in the glass. I should've asked for horseradish, but I was half way done already. \n",
      "\n",
      "Seared ahi tuna: I wish I read through the menu lord carefully, but I didn't remember seeing that the tuna would be crusted with sesame seeds. I'm not a fan of sesame seeds, but I ate them anyways because it took a while to serve us. I tried to cut around the sesame seeds, but I was wasting a lot of fish. \n",
      ".\n",
      "I used to come here often a few years back.  About once a week or every other week.   Great food, but very slow service.   I really don't like it when you first walk in, they don't acknowledge you.  No one greets you, they almost try to avoid eye contact.  It's confusing, you don't know if you're supposed to wait or just go grab a table. If you're supposed to wait be seated, well...no one comes to you.  But then...when you do grab a table, you're unsure if they're going to give you service.  I always have to ask for a menu.... and when I'm ready to order.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Service was slow when we came 2 weeks ago, because there was only one server for our late lunch.  But this made me realized why I stopped coming here.  =/\n",
      "Great service. Very quaint, adorable place. Food is tasty & the ambience is a delight.\n",
      "Awesome food!  The server Brittany was very nice and attentive   I will definitely be back!\n",
      "Good date night. Variety of wines for a small place\n",
      "Food fresh and hot.  Killer mashed potatoes\n",
      "went for a relaxing birthday dinner. \n",
      "Made reservations for 6:45 but got off early so called to come in half hr earlier and it wasn't a problem. \n",
      "We walk in and the bar was full and the restaurant itself was about 40%. \n",
      "We order the Tapas as an appetizer (sorry forgot to take pic). The meatballs and artichoke fried in a pastry puff was amazeballs. Everything else was just ok. \n",
      "E ordered the bone in steak special (around $45). There was some sort of sauce on it. For the amount paid it was pretty fatty. I ordered the blackened chix alfredo. Had entirely too much garlic for me. I only ate about 1/4 of it. \n",
      "The restaurant is pretty dark. Felt bad taking pics bc my flash lit up the room lol. And beware the chairs are super heavy. No really, OMG heavy. Service was great. Our waiter was awesome and checked on us frequently but not so much as to be annoying. I think the owner (cldve been mgr) was walking around and asked how our meal was. Overall I'll go back one day and will try something different but unfortunately it won't be the first place on my list.\n",
      "As soon as I walked in the smell of delicious Italian food filled my nose. The owner Mo was behind the bar greeting guests and cheerily pouring wine for his patrons - off to a great start! \n",
      "\n",
      "Caesar Salad, Penne Vodka (shrimp were huge) and Burrata Platter were out of this world. Also enjoyed a bottle of wine hand selected by Mo. \n",
      "\n",
      "Highly recommended! Prices are great too!\n",
      "This place is always a must visit when I'm in Vegas.  The ambiance is great with a bar in the center. There is a nice wine wall with bottles you can purchase to take home for half off. The menu is large with some of my favorites being the blackened salmon Caesar and the eggplant parm.  It is a great place for both lunch and dinner. The bread you receive before the meal is some of the best bread I've ever had. They bake it fresh every day.\n",
      "My Mom had part of a pastry brushed baked into her Brie!!!! She pulled it out with her fork when cutting a bite. There were hairs from the brush and an entire chunk of it. The waiter never checked to see how our food was when they brought it so she had to go to the back counter and get him. She showed it to him; he took it and a few minutes later a lady, who I assume is the manager, came out and apologized. She said part of the pastry brush had come off in the Brie. How can they not notice that? My husband and I have been coming here for at least 12 years. It has always been one of our favorite restaurants. Apparently, it has been going downhill under the new ownership. In addition to the Brie with a brush inside, my husband didn't get the salad he ordered. The four cheese pizza tastes like they are no longer using high quality ingredients and it took 45 minutes to get. They didn't charge us for the Brie, but that was it. I don't know what I expected, but I certainly thought they would be super apologetic and trying to make it right somehow. My Mom is home feeling sick afraid that she may have eaten some of the pastry brush.\n",
      "I am having trouble reviewing this place as 3 stars is \"A-OK\" but 4 is \"Yay, I'm a fan\".  Well, I'm a fan of some things and kinda disappointed with some others.  I say 3 stars due to the overall experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "*  The place - the décor is inviting and ambience is nice.\n",
      "\n",
      "*  The crowd - not too bad for a Friday night.  We got seated immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "*  The staff - for the most part, friendly - especially our last visit, but there has been other times it was only \"acceptable\" \n",
      "\n",
      "*  The food - the struggle here...  I had some items that were fantastic and some that were downright unacceptable.  \n",
      "\n",
      "- Let's start with the bread that you traditionally get at an Italian restaurant.  This is nothing special.  A loaf, not toasted, not garlic and not even sliced.  They do give you some olive oil and balsamic (no other spices) to dip in.  Blah...if you're dieting, don't waste the carbs here.\n",
      "\n",
      "- I have had the same thing 3 times in a row because when I go to an Italian place, my favorite thing is linguini in red clam sauce, so that's what I got here.  The first couple of times, this was ok but the other night, I got to eat the beach.  It seemed like no one bothered to rinse the clams and every bite I took was gritty.  My dogs got the majority of this meal.  So, for $20 for the entrée without sides, I would say this was the low point of my review\n",
      "\n",
      "- I did have the clam chowder which was excellent and also for desert (because I saved most of my meal for the dogs and had the room), I had tiramisu and it was the best part of eating there that night.  It was fantastic!\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, for the price, I expected more than gritty linguini and clams.  $20 is $20 and that's ok if it's pretty good, but I can't rate the place higher due to the lack of care taken by the cooks.  I would rated a two if the other things were not very good.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not sure I will come back after that.  I can get spaghetti lots of places for less money, but linguini with clams is not so common and I'm ruined on this place for that item now.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A-OK\" it is.....\n",
      "I loved this restaurant. I recently discovered and will be going back again and again. Family run, everything is so fresh, the staff is so welcoming and they really love what they do and have big, genuine smiles on their faces. The place is very charming, food is fresh and delicious. It's a great spot. Sit at the bar, have some wine (they have great wine!) Enjoy! :) \n",
      "\n",
      "Can't wait to go back!\n",
      "A Great Disappointment . Loved the place before they changed hands . From the looks of things the emptiness and Owners attitude . I figure things aren't going well the Eggplant parm wasn't bad the waitress was good . However stale bread ,. And overall non impressiveness of our families taste buds . The best thing was us being together .\n",
      "New to Vegas so decided to check this place out. Their food & service was amazing! I recommend their red sangria\n",
      "Great place for Happy Hour and for dinner.  The owners, Linda and Moeen (hope I am spelling it right) are wonderful.  We also love our Waitress, Brittany but other waiters have been great too.  We were there last night for a wonderful Wine pairing dinner with Tobin James wines.  WOW!  the food was excellent and they managed to serve a whole restaurant all at once.  I HIGHLY recommend this place.  It is our favorite place to take people from out of town.\n",
      "Enjoyed two delicious, excellently prepared meals; chicken parm and salmon as well as a bowl of really good Cream of mushroom soup. Chef Jose, waiter Rudy and Chief Glass Cleaner Michelle were all very gracious and knew the menu and prep in and out. Nicely sized portions without being too much. Best chicken parm I have ever had. Everything was well worth it! Great wine list too.\n",
      "The last couple of times we've been here we had Adam as our server and he has done a great job.  I have Celiac, so I love it when the staff is educated on what is gluten free.  The only thing that would make this place better would be if they had a separate gluten free menu then the staff won't have to check with the chef every time to make sure items were gluten free.\n",
      "Fantastic Service! Best Flowerless Chocolate Cake I have ever had! The Sea Bass and spinach was delightful. However, out of ALL, the mussels and roasted garlic bulbs were my true favorite! A true hidden gem!\n",
      "We've been coming here for years always with our two small Pomeranians. Hector is usually our server and he is always super nice attentive and the food is excellent. It's a little bit off the strip but worth the drive. Please give this fantastic restaurant a chance you won't be disappointed. Thank you once again for a wonderful experience\n",
      "Atmosphere gets 5 stars. Service is excellent, but I'm the only one at the bar for lunch. Wine pour was generous. Nice wine list and not overpriced. But $15 for the chopped salad... um, no. The chicken on tastes like the cubed, ready-chopped chicken. And it's seriously lacking flavor and any ingredients making it remotely in the ballpark of $15.\n",
      "Great ambiance-cozy. good food and wine. Ordered calamari and it was tasty... The bread they serve before the main dish was delish. good place for conversation With someone. A place to remember.\n",
      "We had a good experience here until the dining and end of the meal. At first, our steak salad came out without any dressing on it. When we waved the server down he simply grabbed and extra side of it and brought it to us. No apology, or offer to retoss it in the salad. When we got our check, we had a coupon for a take 20% off a tab non happy hour prices. We gave him it and  he discounted the ticket with the 20% but the tab was more expensive than before! When we inquired he said that we wanted the 20% off and not the HH price which was absolutely ridiculous because it was about a 15$ difference. The greediness was ridiculous and can't say we will be back again. Food was good (once it was prepared correctly) service was good until crap with the greed. 3 stars.\n",
      "Delicious Italian food and a great selection of wine. The ambience is fantastic and very cozy. I had the penne ala vodka sauce with chicken, I would order it again. I was in a group of three and we ordered the cheese plate but it never showed up...other than that, no complaints.\n",
      "This was my first time and we stopped in for lunch. Loved the brick setting of the restaurant. I had the crab stuff shrimp scampi style and my mom had a chopped salad. Both dishes taste delicious . We ordered a flight of wine to sip on for our meal. The whole experience was perfect from our waiter to our food and wine. I will definitely be back.\n",
      "Nailed it! That's all I can say! Okay so let me try to form the words.  Went to Grape Vine tonight and the food is glorious. Amazing. Delectable. The drinks are great. I had two of their specialty wines by the glass and I was quite surprised by how good they were. The steak I had was one of the best ever. The flavors I experienced were amazing - It literally melted in my mouth... In a grandacious way. The desserts... Yum the desserts!! Best thing though is the service - the owner Linda is the most friendly and gracious hostess imaginable. My new go-to place in LV.\n",
      "Service was terrible, the server was rude, and the server knew nothing about the menu. When asking what was in a special he would say \"oh you know\" and a I think peppers and you know...clearly we didn't know that's why we asked! Food wasn't very flavorful. The happy hour wine was a good deal but they served it in a dirty glass with dish detergent or something in it. The manager argued it was settling of the wine...he actually tasted it and agreed it wasn't sugar settled. We spent about$100 and my date went home hungry. Unfortunately we won't be back...we purchased a Groupon and already have had it refunded.  So many better places for the money! We were hoping to find a new regular place to go but this one didn't make the cut.\n",
      "UPDATE:\n",
      "The owner private messaged me and accused me of trying to use a Groupon on happy hour and I only wrote this because it made me mad...you cannot use Groupon on happy hour as it's stated in the Groupon...I never tried to use the Groupon when the bill came...I returned the Groupon because we were never going back there due to the terrible service, dirty dishes, and poor food. She then tried to tell me the glass wasn't dirty and was settled wine (that only happens on a good bottle) as she would say. Again we both had 3 glasses of wine...none of them had the issue but the one glass...I told the man that came to the table to try it...he actually did in front of us and said...so sorry that is a dirty glass and not the crystals that can form! Instead of taking any fault the owner tried to say they're perfect and we got such a great discount on happy hour it shouldn't matter! If something isn't good it's not worth $1. Just because you put a high price tag on something doesn't mean it's worth it. The owner also said shame on me for leaving a 1 star review. Good luck at this terrible place if you decide to go here!!!\n",
      "This place is AMAZING! I feel like i walk into a family members kitchen! The bread should be illegal,  its that great!!! Im not a frequent poster, its got to be great or horrible, this place is AMAZING!!! Glad i heard about it!! Steak salad, homemade bread, personality and a thank u on my way out....im in!!!\n",
      "Had a 15% off coupon from the ValPak that comes in the mail so we decided to try this place.  It is a nice place and we were able to eat outside because it wasn't too hot.  Had the crab stuffed shrimp, a Margherita pizza with goat cheese.  Both items were amazing.  Had a glass of sparkling rose to go with it.  Everything was great and the food was pretty high quality but I couldn't help thinking for the amount spent, we could have had more food or more to drink elsewhere.  Great place with solid service, just on the high priced side.\n",
      "A true gem - The Grape Vine Cafe- delicious dining in a superb venue. Everyone always feels at home,  co- owners Moeen and Linda make sure they meet and greet their guests with a warm welcome- like coming home after a long day. The wine list is excellent!! They also are having a wine presentation and dinner on Dec 6th, be sure to attend for a festive and delicious evening, fine wine and dining.  Thank you again to Rudy for your most professional service and care. When you are in the neighborhood, come in and enjoy!! Taking Christmas Eve reservations now also! Try the delicious crab stuffed shrimp, mussels in white wine sauce and, of course, penne with chicken in a Gorgonzola sauce!! The baked Brie is special! Enjoy!!\n",
      "Amazing restaurant,  loved it when it was Grape Street and still love it.   Great service,  great food,  great wine and love that you can buy bottles at a discount to take home.   Favorite dish always includes the zucchini pomodoro,  rare to find a paleo \"pasta\"!\n",
      "Great food, nice happy hour selections and I would have given it 4 or 5 stars, but they allowed two guys way drunk to sit at the bar and use such profane language we had to leave.\n",
      "We've been here when it was the Grapewine cafe. Didn't care for it much so decided to try it again since it changed ownership. We started with the cheese and fruit plate. It had 5 thin and I mean see through thin pieces of cheese on it, a handful of chopped walnuts, a handful of grapes, 2 slices of hard pear and 6 slices of green apple, no fig as the menu stated. It was basically a fruit and nut plate since the amount of cheese couldn't even cover a cracker. For the entree we split the eggplant parmesan. I like that they split it for you and bring it on 2 separate plates, but it was very dry as there was hardly any marinara sauce on it. I don't understand why there are so many 4 and 5 stars reviews here raving about the food. Maybe it was because we had a groupon for $30 worth of food so we were shortchanged on the cheese and sauce. We did order 4 glasses of wine so it wasn't as if it was a small tab. We will never be back.\n",
      "came here in September for my birthday dinner.  \n",
      "The place is very nice....located in the plaza behind Walgreen, Pink Donuts, Starbucks and an array of other shops located off of Lake Mead and Buffalo.\n",
      "We walked in to a romantic setting.  Service was excellent and so was my steak.  The reason for 4 stars was because our appetizer platter was just blah.\n",
      "Will definitely recommend.\n",
      "This is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. Linda the owner is awesome and always takes care of us when we visit. The bartenders are always so friendly and always remember what kind of wine I like.\n",
      "\n",
      "My favorite dish is the simple spaghetti and meatballs. They do this classic dish perfectly and I am always waiting for the next time I have it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Although I don't live in Vegas anymore, I'll definitely return when I'm in Vegas visiting my family. It's me and my Moms favorite place to catch up.\n",
      "Big fan of this place.  Great atmosphere and awesome wine list.  Parking is easy since it is off the strip.  I recommend the chilean sea bass or the short ribs.  The prices are just right for a good dinner out of the house.  This restaurant is a go to for me!\n",
      "It's hard to find a nice atmosphere with incredible food and great wines, but this place does it! The server was incredibly friendly and the food melts in your mouth. They have a great wine list and unlike many places, a dining area that feels both fancy and comfortable.\n",
      "We had dinner with good friends at Grape Vine. It was just our 2nd time since the new ownership. We found the service excellent and the food wonderful. We had lamb chops, Ali tuna, sea bass and New York steak. So good as well as salads and tapa platter.  We met the new owner who was attentive and we enjoyed our conversation. Same menu as the old Grape Street that moved to Summerlin. We find this location easier to get in and out and highly recommend it for great dinning and wine bargains on the half off nights. A new favorite place!!\n",
      "We would give a 4.5 star but since Brandon gave us such good service we would rather give a 5 star. :)\n",
      "This place is very fairly price which we loved especially considering the ambiance. It is very romantic with perfect decor to match. \n",
      "We started our meal with an order of Brie $14 this is a must try and should be ordered with your drinks. We really dont like to wait 20 min for an appetizer but it was worth the wait. It was cooked to perfection, complemented with green apples, grapes, and hazelnuts. Its a must try!!\n",
      " Hazza to the chef!! The Blacken Chicken Alfredo $18 was delicious! Whenever we try a new Italian spot I always try the alfredo, if it meets my standards we will return to explore the menu further. I figure if they get it right everything else will be good too. It was so good I ate more bread so I could soak up more sauce! They also added pees which was a nice change and a good balance to the ACTUAL blacken chicken!! I finally found a place that does it right! It was not over cooked and definitely did not lack flavor. \n",
      "The prosciutto pizza $16 was pretty good considering its another item that is often done badly. The crust was delicious and crispy on the outside while still being soft inside and not thick. The cheese was portioned wonderfully. However, the sweet onions were a bit much and over powered the other flavors. Now to the main ingredient the prosciutto it was amazing but lacked in size and quantity. Over all we enjoyed it but with prosciutto the more the better! We would even pay more for more of it. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was a great dining experience and we will be back. It was a nice change and my tummy is very happy!! \n",
      "\n",
      "If your looking for a good Italian spot this is a must try.\n",
      "We were there for happy hour and were not disappointed. There were many reduced selections from the appetizer menu. I selected the ahi tuna appetizer. It was just the right size and included seaweed salad on top and slices of avocado with toasted pita chips on the side. The hummus ordered at the table also looked appealing. Wines are half price too.\n",
      "The food is fine...but you can find as good or better nearby for similar prices.  Nice atmosphere so good for a date night..  I've been coming here for years, 7-8 times a year.  But here's the problem that occurred...causing me great embarrassment.  And the owner of the restaurant did nothing to help me (even though I'm a good customer).\n",
      "\n",
      "I had purchased a $15 discount coupon for Grape Vine online from a well known, reputable company.  I included this with my cash payment for the bill (which included a generous tip - I like the servers to share in any discount I get!)  The server returned to the table, held up my coupon and informed me that they would not honor it - that there was a sign on their door about it (that I didn't see).  As you can imagine, this was embarrassing - especially in front of my date.\n",
      "\n",
      "I contacted the owner a day later, and she explained that the coupon company had made an error in offering coupons for Grape Vine and it had been a problem for them.  She said that I would have to contact the company myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "I suggested that if this happens again with other customers, it would be better to train their servers to not humiliate customers - for $15!  I also found out that Grape Vine DOES offer a 20% discount to the public via Val Pak - if this had been offered/applied, it would have covered the $15 no problem - without embarrassing me.  I consult on marketing/business for a living.  This would have made me a raving fan...instead of feeling like a pest.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for a lousy $15, Grape Vine's owner feels that being \"right\" is more important than keeping a customer that spends $600-$800 there every year.  Over 10 years, that would be $6-8K.  Oh, and what about those I'll tell about this experience?  Conservatively, being right will cost them $15,000.00.  No wonder the place was empty at 9:30 on a Friday night.\n",
      "Solid place.  Great food great service,  nice ambiance.  Great place for date night. Nice Italian food, steaks and seafood specials are great too.  Definitely must try.\n",
      "Great food and service! Was especially impressed when a server chased us down in the parking lot when I accidentally forgot my cellphone/wallet on the table.\n",
      "We went in for Happy Hour with 16 people. Baked brie was excellent. Service was outstanding.  Everyone was very nice. We will definitely go back.\n",
      "Great food, outstanding service, and a pleasant ambience (with amazing iron chairs). The menu is not surprising, but the preparation is remarkable and creative. Highly recommended.\n",
      "The staff at Grape Vine are awesome. I was able to come early and drop off a surprise cake for my husband. Brian and Rudy were excellent in taking care of our party. The food was excellent and hot when it came out.  We never needed to ask for refills on drinks. I will be coming back.\n",
      "Such a nice dinner tonight!  We had a Groupon so we thought we would try this restaurant. In the mood for spaghetti, and I'm kinda picky and I loved it. The bread was great and Mandy was excellent!  Friendly and efficient. We will certainly return!\n",
      "You don't have to endure the higher cost of Vegas Strip restaurants to get great food and a phenomenal wine selection for a reasonable price.  I now include a stop at Grape Vine whenever I am in Las Vegas.\n",
      "\n",
      "The specials are always great and the pasta dishes superb - with seemingly family sized portions for the price of a single entree.  And half price Monday specials on bottles of wine - what more do you need to know!\n",
      "\n",
      "Just go, you'll agree with me.\n",
      "Although they charge $16 for a glass of wine where you can buy the whole bottle at Lees for $22 the food is great and priced well. Service is good and they have a nice happy hour where you can get the wine half    Price.\n",
      "Love this place! Our go-to for every special occasion. Great food, beautiful decor, and wonderful service. Always have a good experience here.\n",
      "This is a real find! Friendly service, lovely decor w/sweet background music, and fresh and very tasty Greek & other foods. Wow, my new favorite place - next time we'll come for happy hour!\n",
      "What a great event\n",
      "Tobin James wine\n",
      "Amazing food \n",
      "Wonderful server Adam\n",
      "Every detail was amazing\n",
      "This restaurant I very nice. You walk in from a suburban strip mall into a nice atmosphere with a touch of Napa feel with the winery feel.  Our meals were excellent. My mom had the\n",
      "Newly opened as grape vine. It used to be grape street which was better.  The food is good but for the money you can do much better...$17 for a small average pizza is a little silly.  Btw...wait staff was excellent.  Here is why I give it 2 stars...there is a sign outside that says \"$3 drafts all day sunday\".  We were charged $8 for an ipa draft.  The manager walked by so I asked her about it and she told me that it was an old sign and they needed to take it down. I let it go but after thinking about it that is crap.  If you have a sign outside that says $3 beers on Sunday you should honor it until you take it down.  Management failure.  Think I'll go to the new Grape Street in Summerlin.\n",
      "Absolutely  horrible experience! There was no host to greet us. The crab stuffed shrimp appetizer was completely overcooked. I ordered the seafood pasta, and my husband ordered the 22 oz bone in ribeye. The ribeye was delicious,  but my seafood was once again, SO OVERCOOKED! And then to top it off, we had a gift card for $100 for the restaurant. The address on the back of the card was correct, although the manager would not accept it because of some incident with the previous owner over a legal issue. We are SO PISSED RIGHT NOW! RIDICULOUS!   I asked why they did not have a sign posted about not being able to accept the cards/certificates, and the manager said it was at the host table. If it actually was there when we entered the establishment,  we didn't see it. However, when we left, we saw.the 10 point font memo about the issue! Who could notice that? We asked our server when we sat down about the name change from 'grape street' to 'grape vine' cafe. We are so sad. It was our six year anniversary,  we wanted to have a wonderful tine and we're so disappointed! Make sure if you have a 'grape street cafe and wine bar' gift card DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION!!!\n",
      "What a great experience!  My wife, friends and myself came to a wine dinner that was spectacular!  Adam was our server and was very attentive, knowledgeable  and kind!  Thank you for a great night and possibly the best wine dinner in town.  Great atmosphere with brick, wood and black iron accents.\n",
      "I can't tell you how many enjoyable moments I've had here.\n",
